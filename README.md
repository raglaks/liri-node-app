# liri-node-app

A command line node app that takes in user input and returns data (from APIs) accordingly. This was the first homework assignment for Node.js in my full-stack web development bootcamp. Technically, it basically fetches data from different APIs--based on one of the four possible commands--and displays everything neatly. 

I didn't run into any major problems while doing this. I learned a good deal about NPM packages and how useful they can be for a variety of projects. I hope to dive deeper into NPMs in the future. 

If you want to run this, remember to create a .env file for the Spotify API keys. You'll also need to NPM install dotenv and generate your Spotify keys to run everything smoothly.
